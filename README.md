# Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository contains various projects which demonstrate famous AI algorithms. 
The focus of the algorithms centres around formulating problems into search problems. The files showcase the following search algorithms:
- Breadth First Search (BFS.py)
- Depth First Search (DFS.py)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS.py)
- AStar Search Algorithm (AStar.py)
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP.py)
- Local Search (Local.py)
- Minimax / AB-pruning (AB.py)
